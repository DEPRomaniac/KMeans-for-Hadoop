# KMeans-for-Hadoop
Implementation of the big data clustering method KNN based on MapReduce and utilizing Hadoop

The purpose of this project is to create a Java framework for using Hadoop MapReduce to perform k-means clustering, which is a commonly used algorithm for dividing a set of data points into k clusters. K-means clustering is suitable for large datasets and is well-suited for parallelization due to its algorithmic characteristics.
